# DevFleet (Legacy Shim)

Use this only if you still call `/devfleet`. The maintained workflow lives in `skills/codex-devfleet/SKILL.md`.

## Canonical Surface

- Prefer the `codex-devfleet` skill directly.
- Keep this file only as a compatibility entry point while command-first usage is retired.

## Arguments

`$ARGUMENTS`

## Delegation

Apply the `codex-devfleet` skill.
- Plan from the user's description, show the DAG, and get approval before dispatch unless the user already said to proceed.
- Prefer polling status over blocking waits for long missions.
- Report mission IDs, files changed, failures, and next steps from structured mission reports.
